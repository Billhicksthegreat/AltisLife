				For a more detailed explanation of the rules visit our forums at forums.life-nexus.com.<br/><br/>

				1. Before killing someone you must initiate hostile RP with a command. You can then kill them ONLY if they do not comply. The only exception is red zones. See RDM section.<br/>
				2. If you initiate with any member of a gang, you are initiated with the entire gang. This works both ways.<br/>
				3. If you have been initiated with you must wait 5 minutes before logging off. Failure to do so is considered combat logging and you will be banned.<br/>
				4. Do not speak in side chat EVER or in group chat during server restart.<br/>
				5. Your vehicle is a method of transportation, not a weapon. Using it as a weapon will get you banned. See VDM section.<br/><br/>

				5. Ask if they will submit to a search.<br/>
